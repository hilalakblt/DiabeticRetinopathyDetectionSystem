# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection System

Diabetic Retinopathy is the most common eye disease in the world and it can cause blindness. It is about blood sugar levels. Both eyes are affected and this disease leads to partial or complete loss of vision. Improvements of computer science like artificial intelligence and deep learning provide a way to detect Diabetic Retinopathy in early stages. In this way, the chance of recovery of patients can be increased. In this project, the EfficientNet models and Transfer Learning method were used to detect levels of disease. A real-world retinal dataset was used and some image processing techniques are applied to the dataset. Also, this project is presented as a web-based project and system users can upload a retinal image to see the detection and levels of disease. Finally, our accuracy is over 91% for multi classification training dataset and this system provides some functionality like adding, deleting patients and detecting disease and saving.

In this web-based deep learning project, a real-time detection system was developed. A retinal image is uploaded to the system and after the preprocessing technique the system detects the level of disease. There are four levels and a No DR level of disease. After saving the information to the database, it can be shown that all of the information about patients. It
provides that deleting the patient records if the user has permission.

Diabetic Retinopathy Detection System has an easy usage and a simple interface. The users consist of doctors. Doctors can have different dispositions and because of that every user cannot do everything. After the login, the detection page of the website is shown and it detects a disease level of a patient when the user clicks the “Detect” button.

Here is the high level of the system. React JS was used for the frontend and Python was used for the backend.

In addition, transfer learning was used for the detection disease. You can see it other repository, also you can read all documentation of the project from this link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QkEF7ps78nMqagXWxdMJ87k4QjEe3x8m/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113027671940448470385&rtpof=true&sd=true
